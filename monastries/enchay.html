      <h2>History & Significance</h2>
      <p>Rumtek Monastery, also known as the Dharmachakra Centre, is a vibrant and significant Tibetan Buddhist monastery located in Sikkim, India. It serves as the main seat of the Karma Kagyu lineage outside of Tibet. The original monastery was built in the mid-18th century but was later rebuilt in the 1960s by the 16th Karmapa, Rangjung Rigpe Dorje, who settled in Sikkim after fleeing Tibet.</p>
      <p>The monastery is a replica of the original Kagyu headquarters in Tibet and is renowned for its stunning architecture, intricate murals, and collection of priceless religious scriptures and artifacts.</p>
